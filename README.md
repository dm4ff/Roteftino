Even with an Arduino Uno you can create a nice TFT based application.
In this case, an antenna rotator that reacts to the touchscreen to change direction.
What you need:
- Arduino Uno
- TFT with touch from Seedstudios (or compatible to ILI9431)
- An Arduino prototype board whoch goes between the TFT and the Uno
- If you like, a pot to set a value by turning the pot, or / and two tap keys for manual left/right operation
- two relays to drive the motor left/right
